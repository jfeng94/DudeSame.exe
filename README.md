# Prerequisite Installs
In order to get this to run, we need a few things. Here is a list of things we need:

	* NodeJS (> v4.4.0)
	* Bower (through NodeJS)
	* MongoDB

## NodeJS
	Find it online for your respective OS

## Bower
	Once you've installed nodeJS and it's affiliated package manager, npm, simply type in:

	`npm install -g bower`

	We will then have two package managers; bower and nodeJS. Bower will take care of the front end packages, while NodeJS will take care of the backend packages.

## MongoDB
	This will be the database we'll be using. You don't really need to install it, but if you want MongoDB to manually check the database stuff, here is how to install:

	For Mac:
		* `brew update`
		* `brew install mongodb`

	For Ubuntu:
		TODO
